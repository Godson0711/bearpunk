      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Bear Punks is not just another NFT collection. It's a bold vision
         of utility, community, and blockchain-powered adventure. 
         Our goal is to merge digital collectibles with real value,
          offering holders more than art — a gateway to experiences, rewards, and innovation.

      <h2>2. What is Bear Punks?</h2>
      <p>
        Bear Punks is a limited collection of 1,111 uniquely illustrated digital bears.
         Each NFT is a hand-crafted totem of identity and utility — symbolizing strength,
          community, and tech-forward thinking. These NFTs live on the Ethereum blockchain and serve as a key to the entire Bear Punks ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our artwork is designed with care and culture. Every Bear carries a story, and as a holder, you’re not just collecting art — you’re becoming part of a movement built on transparency, long-term value, and access.

      <h2>3. Vision & Mission</h2>
      <p>
        We envision a future where NFTs go beyond JPEGs — evolving into experiences, access passes, and utility assets. Bear Punks is designed to give its community real-world advantages through staking, token rewards, dApp access, and exclusive contests. Our mission is to empower a digital tribe of creators, investors, and dreamers through decentralized assets.
